If you want to play this game, use **Google Chrome** and first check that there are no windows opened </br>
Then, in the **Ubuntu** terminal type: ``google-chrome --autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required``
This is because Google Chrome does not let the background-music and background-image autoplay by default

Then, go to https://anth0ny-pereira-neon-race-rave.herokuapp.com/ AND ENJOY :)
